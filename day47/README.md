# Day 47 - Implement a singly linked list

Write a program to implement a singly linked list

### Linked Lists

#### Source: [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/linked-list/)

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers

### Advantages of Linked Lists

1. Dynamic size
2. Ease of insertion/deletion

### Disadvantages of Linked Lists

1. A middle element can't be accessed directly, only traversal is possible
2. Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list
