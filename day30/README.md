# Day 29 - Search and Sort Algorithms Part C: Naive Pattern Search

So this week is for searching and sorting algorithms, and we did linear search and binary search yesterday, and today's algorithm would be the Naive Search.

## Question

Given a sentence (string), and a pattern, write a function that returns the index of found pattern. Since it is used for pattern searching, after doing it also have a look at KMP algorithm for pattern searching (We already did the KMP algorithm while string problems series, but since today's topic is searching, it deserves a place here as well 😁)

**Example**

```
input: 
  str = "Hello World, Coding is beautiful"
  pattern = "World"

output: 6 (start index of the found pattern)
```
