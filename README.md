## [More Problems](./BONUS/README.md)

A real coder should not be satisfied by doing only one problem daily, rather he/she should keep coding as much as possible. So, here I ([@MadhavBahlMD](https://github.com/MadhavBahlMD)) am adding some more problems that you can practise 😃

Also, these problems have been taking form various sources, so ig you think you own any of the given problems, just send me an email at theleanprogrammer@gmail.com and I will be more than happy to give proper credits 😊

#### Want to contribute?

The file structure is as follows

```
\DAILY CODE BASE
├───BONUS
│   ├───Algorithms
│   ├───Arrays
│   ├───Graphs
│   ├───LinkedLists
│   ├───Queues
│   ├───Recursion
│   ├───Stacks
│   ├───Strings
│   └───Trees
```

In this main `README.md`, there are links to the README of `BONUS` directory, and the `README.md` of sub topics
In the `README.md` of `BONUS` directory, there is the list of all topics and under that there are all questions
In the `README.md` of any topic directory, say `Arrays` there is a README which contains all questions of that topic along with the link to the `README.md` of the directory containing the question
The `README.md` of directory containing the question must contain all the information about the question with some examples and the solution, and a little writeup about the algorithm used.

**Before contributing any question, make sure that this structure is followed properly**

#### NOTE

In case you just want to contribute a question and not code, there is no need to do so many things, just open an issue with the topic **Problem Submission** and the problem in the comments. I'll add it myself, and will give you proper credits 😃
