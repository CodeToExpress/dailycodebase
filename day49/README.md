# Day 49 - MiddleMost Node Search

Given a singly linked list, find it's middle-most element, **without** knowing the size of the linked list or using any counter variable.

### Example

```
given linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3
output: 2

given linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
output: 2
```

### HINT

ðŸ‘‰ Make 2 pointer variables which would iterate over the Linked List, such that in each iteration, first variable moves 1 step forward, and the second pointer variable moves 2 steps forward. 

ðŸ‘‰ When the second pointer reaches the end, first pointer would reach to the middlemost element
