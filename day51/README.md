# Day 51 - Circular List

Ques) Given a Linked List, write a function `isCircular()` which returns true if the list is circular, false if it is not.

### Circular Linked List

Circular linked list is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked list or doubly circular linked list.

Basically, there is no NULL at the end, rather the "last" element points again to the first element.
