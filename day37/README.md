# Day 37 - Search and Sort Algorithms Part J: Applications

Now that we are practising searching and sorting algorithms since past 2 weeks, it's the time to do some questions that involves their usage. Since the weeekend is here, try out these problems.

A huge shoutout to Hackerearth and Geeks4Geeks for having such great collecton of problems. 

Try out as many problems as you can, the contribution guidelines for today would be a little different (I've mentioned them after this list of links)

## Contribution Guidelines

1. Make a folder in this directory (day37), and the name of the folder should be the name of the problem (Example: ```divide apples```).
2. In the folder add the README.md 
3. Copy paste the question and sample input output in the README.md
4. Add credits at the start like this

```
Question Source: HackerEarth
Question Link: https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/sorting/heap-sort/practice-problems/algorithm/divide-apples/
```

5. Add your code to README
6. Add the file containing the code in the same directory.
